	<h3>1. Choosing a Scripture Passage</h3>
	<p> Choosing a Scripture passage is one of the most important parts of an exegesis. Make a thoughtful choice from the list of passages that your professor provides. What passage are you curious about? Which one sticks out in your mind so that you wonder whether there is something deeper than what you are reading? Remember, you're going to be spending a lot of time looking at these verses, so you should choose one in which you have a personal interest. <br /><br />This table is set up to provide some <strong>tips</strong> if you are exegeting a passage from the New Testament:</p>

	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="15%"><div align="center"><strong>Gospels</strong></div></td>
			<td width="30%">Matthew, Mark, Luke, John</td>
			<td>Make sure you compare the stories, narratives, and parables between these books. Resources like Kurt Aland's <u>Synopsis of the Four Gospels</u> are very useful. The Gospel of John should also be compared to the letters of 1, 2, and 3 John. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div align="center"><strong>Acts</strong></div></td>
			<td>Acts</td>
			<td>The book of Acts appears to be in solitude in style, but there are some important things to remember. First, Acts was written after the Gospel of Luke and continues where Luke leaves off. Second, be sure and look at the various letters especially the letters of Paul to see similarities between Paul's journeys and his writings.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div align="center"><strong>Pauline Corpus </strong></div></td>
			<td>Romans, 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians, Philemon, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Titus,</td>
			<td><p>Paul's Church Epistles were written to various churches and therefore address issues within congregations and define a Christian's relationship with the world. Be sure and look for parallels between these books since many times Paul addresses similar issues in many churches.</p></td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div align="center"><strong>Hebrews and the General Epistles </strong></div></td>
			<td>Hebrews, James, 1 &amp; 2 Peter, 1, 2, &amp; 3 John, Jude</td>
			<td>The General Epistles were written by multiple authors, all of whom have some controversies involved with their authorship.                  </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div align="center"><strong>Revelation </strong></div></td>
			<td>Revelation</td>
			<td>Revelation is the only book in the New Testament that is considered primarily&quot;apocalyptic literature.&quot; Because of this, there may not be many obvious parallels to the New Testament books. However, you should look at Old Testament works like Daniel and New Testament books that contain sections of apocalyptic work (like Matthew)for parallels. Be sure and pay attention to the Jewish connections in Revelation and the life setting of your passages.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<h3>2. Reading The Entire Passage</h3>
	<p>
		After you have selected your passage, the next step is to <strong>read the entire book or letter</strong> in which your passage is located. The main idea of this exercise is to start fitting the passage's meaning with the rest of the book or letter, not to skim the book to meet class requirements.<br />
		During your reading, you might want to take notes on what you are reading. <strong>Below is a list of example questions you may want to see if you can answer.</strong>
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Can you identify any special emphases or concerns in the book?</li>
		<li>What do you think the purpose of this book is?</li>
		<li>Who are the recipients of the book? Are they Jews? Gentiles? Both?</li>
		<li>Do the recipients have a relationship with the author?</li>
		<li>What kind of relationship?</li>
		<li>What do you think the meaning of the passage is?</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Write out any more questions specific to your book or passage that you thought about.  This will help identify some of the issues you will want to address through your research and in your paper.</p>

<h3>3. Reading Different Translations</h3>
<p>After you have chosen your topic and read the entire book or letter, you should read your selected passage in different modern translations. The following picture illustrates the difference between the various translations. (1) </p>

            <p><strong>You will want to avoid the works that are under the &quot;Paraphrase&quot; category since these will not be  as accurate with the Greek and Hebrew language.<br />
            <br />
            </strong> If you are still unsure of what translation to use, the following list are popular and accepted.            </p>

                <td width="30%"><strong>New American Bible (NAB)</strong></td>
                <td>Composed by Catholic scholars. Purpose was to be as accurate to Greek thought as possible. Also used older texts found in Dead Sea Scrolls. </td>

                <td>Composed by large group of translators. In most instances, fits the ideas intended to be expressed by original Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. </td>

                  R 220.52 B471niv<br />

                <td>Updated from the Revised Standard Version (RSV) for accuracy,
                  more intelligible English, and greater clarity. </td>
                <td>Benner Library Call Number:<br />
