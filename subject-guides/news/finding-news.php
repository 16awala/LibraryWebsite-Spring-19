<p class="title-font">Daily newspapers are available in the BROWSE area on the main level. Newspapers are held 1-3 months, depending on the title, and stored in tech services, available upon request at the Circulation Desk.  News journals and magazines, (Time, Newsweek, etc.), are kept different amounts of time, based on historical value and use.  Some are hard bound every year.  They are shelved in Lower Level Periodicals with some titles first displaying the newest issue in the BROWSE area on the main level of the library.</p>
