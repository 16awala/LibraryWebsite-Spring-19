    <p>This lab complements and supports your work in Historiography. In this <strong>hands-on lab</strong> you'll apply search techniques and explore resources, with the help of a librarian, to refine your prospectus topic, conduct a literature search for secondary sources, and begin to find primary sources. A <strong>class field trip</strong> supplements lab sessions and will expose you to the ways historians preserve history and information.</p>

    <p>Each class member will document his or her research process through <strong>Discussion Board Postings (<a href="http://annanonymous.blogspot.com/2005/10/hooray-sources.html" target="_blank">sample student blog posting</a>)</strong>. Classmates provide a sounding board during in-class discussion. Reflecting on the process of research through postings and discussion will encourage you--as you see your own progress, and will emphasize the importance of a systematic approach to investigating your topic. </p>

    <p>This <strong>website</strong> will remain active next year, while you work on your senior thesis.</p>
