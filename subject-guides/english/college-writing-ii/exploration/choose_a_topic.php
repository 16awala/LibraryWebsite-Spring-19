<h2 class="header-line">Choose a topic</h2>

	<p>Begin with an area that interests you.  Ideally, you will chose a topic from your major, so that you will get experience using the databases for your academic discipline.<br /><br />
	Defining a topic is actually one of the most challenging phases of the research process. It involves:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identifying and selecting a general topic</li>
		<li>Exploring, by conducting background research</li>
		<li>Narrowing &amp; clarifying your topic</li>
	</ul>

			<p>Researcher Carol Collier Kuhlthau invested more than 20-years into developing a model to describe the actions and feelings of researchers.  Her <a href="http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/ckuhlthau/information-search-process/" target="_blank">Information Search Process</a> (ISP) explains that during the exploration stage, your may feel optimistic when you choose a general topic area, but then frustrated, confused, and uncertain as you wade through information.  Some people are tempted to abandon the search entirely, feeling they aren’t up to the task or that the tools are too frustrating.  Don’t give up!  <br /><br />  
			If you’ve just been assigned a research project and you’re feeling uncertain or even a little apprehensive, don’t worry!  This is normal.</p>

<h4>Actions you can take</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Talk with a <a href="/contact/ask-a-librarian.php">librarian</a>
		<li>Make a <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/constructingaconceptmap.php" target="_blank">concept map</a> to help organize your ideas and background information
			<ul>
				<li>Construct a focus question (what problem or issue do you want the concept map to help resolve?)</li>
				<li>Identify key concepts</li>
				<li>Rank order the concepts</li>
				<li>Construct an initial concept map using linking words like, “provides, have, in order to, ”</li>
				<li>Revise as you learn more</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Don’t give up!</li>
	</ul>
