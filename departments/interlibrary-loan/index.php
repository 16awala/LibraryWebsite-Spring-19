<h1>Interlibrary Loan</h1>
	<div class="split l50-r50 cf">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The Interlibrary Loan department borrows items for Olivet patrons, and lends Benner Library materials to other institutionsâ€™ patrons. Materials include journal articles, books, and media.
			</p>

			<p>If you need materials not immediately available through BLISweb or I-Share, you may request them through Interlibrary Loan (ILL).  This service allows us to access materials from thousands of other libraries throughout the world, including hundreds in Illinois.  ILL is available only to Olivet students, faculty and staff.
