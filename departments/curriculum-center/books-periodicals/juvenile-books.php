	<p>       
		The Juvenile area is a collection of books used by students enrolled in courses dealing with literature for children and young adults. Juvenile books are divided into three sections: nonfiction, picture books, and fiction. The Juvenile collection is not a sample of a public library collection and should not be viewed as such. Some dated and controversial material is selected for student evaluation. Children may peruse the collection only in the company of an adult.
