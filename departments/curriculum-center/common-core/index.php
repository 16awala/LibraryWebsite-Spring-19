<h1>Common Core Resources</h1>
	<p>
		Benner Library seeks to purchase, provide, and promote resources that support the implementation of the Common Core State Standards in the classroom.  This page provides links to some helpful resources related to the Common Core. Materials supporting Common Core can be located by searching our <?php echo print_resource('967', 'basic', 'no-li', 'no_proxy'); ?> or browsing resources listed below.
    </p>

	<p>
		Some of the Common Core textbooks and non-fiction resources were purchased through a grant from the federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) as administrated by the Illinois State Library. These materials particularly address the Reading: Informational Text Standards.  Below are some sample lists of resources located in the Curriculum Center that relate to some topics found in the Social Studies textbooks purchased through the LSTA grant.
