				Beyond assisting patrons with searches for materials, student assistants working at this desk are responsible to help maintain a safe and secure environment in which patrons are expected to adhere to library guidelines and protocol. Other main duties include general reception, keeping the floor in good order, reshelving and maintaining the accurate order of materials, restocking art supplies, and preparing new items for the shelves. These student assistants should be detail-oriented, willing to adhere to established policies, and be reliable and punctual. Higher pay levels are available to students as they become experienced with the department or achieve higher levels of responsibility. <br /><br />
				Watch for library job openings on My Olivet under Student Support --> Career Services --> On Campus Jobs. Use the Student Job Application link in the footer of any page on the library website.  Please read the form carefully when filling it out.  It is important to fill out all applicable fields as completely as possible with proper grammar and punctuation.
