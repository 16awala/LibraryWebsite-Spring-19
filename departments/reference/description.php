<h1>Reference Department Description</h1>
	<p>
		The Benner Library Reference Department is responsible for helping library patrons meet their information needs through understanding library resources and using effective searching strategies. Some of the methods used to answer reference questions are determining the exact nature of the information need, teaching the patron how to access and use Benner Libraryâ€™s resources as well as those materials held at other libraries and how to interlibrary loan those items, and referring patrons to experts more knowledgeable about a topic.
