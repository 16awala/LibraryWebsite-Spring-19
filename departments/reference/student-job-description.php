			<p>
				Generally the two types of positions in the Reference Department are filled by upperclassmen who have taken a research class in their field of study and have a thorough knowledge of the ONU campus. The Reference Assistant generally works during the day and assists with the ongoing needs of the department, including shelving new reference books, creating timely displays of library materials, preparing for library events and contests, weeding, informing librarians of observed collection weaknesses, and working Reference Desk shifts. The Reference Monitor works two late night shifts from 9:00 p.m. until midnight and at least two day hours during the week at the Reference Desk. At night the Reference Monitor works with the Evening Circulation Supervisor to monitor the library, making regular rounds throughout the building to help maintain an atmosphere conducive to studying, but may also answer reference questions when it is appropriate.<br /><br />
