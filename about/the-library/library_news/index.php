<h1>Library News</h1>

  <h5 class="center">Please join us for a dedication ceremony for</h5>
  <h4 class="center">The Center for Academic Excellence</h4>
  <h5 class="center">Friday, October 26, 11am - 12pm.<br /><br /></h5>

	<p>
    The Center for Academic Excellence will be moving into the library and will include Academic Coaching, Career Services, and Online learning. A new Writing Center will also be located in the library. Adding these areas of expertise to the library footprint will help integrate their services with our library services to support academic excellence for the entire Olivet community.<br /><br />
    Librarians selectively reduced and reorganized the print collection over the last few years in order to protect and enhance student work spaces and allow for the additional people and offices.  Mrs. Bowling served as both the decorator and user advocate, creating a new look that is practical and fun.<br /><br />
    With help from Center for Teaching & Learning, a new kiosk was added to gather quick opinions to queries about the space and services.  The tool is called Happy or Not.  Responses are welcome to any question posted.  Look for it in the library!<br /><br />
    Changes and adjustments to space will continue as new offices are integrated throughout the building and unique student work spaces and services are added. Watch the Benner announcements to see what is new!<br />
