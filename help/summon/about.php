<h2 class="header-line">About</h2>

   <p>Summon is our brand-new comprehensive search engine which searches across almost all of the libraryâ€™s resources, including BLISweb, e-books, e-journals, and Digital Commons (our institutional repository).  Look for the search box in the top right hand corner of the updated Benner Library website.<br /><br />

	One of the main features of the new Summon search is the sidebar. With it you can dynamically refine your search in several ways.  For example,  you can limit by date or type of resource (e.g.,  peer reviewed articles)  and you can add or exclude terms.  The new Summon gives you total control over your Benner library search experience.
