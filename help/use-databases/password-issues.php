<h2 class="header-line">Password Issues</h2>
    
	<p>
		The password used to access the library databases and eResources is referred to by IT as your ONUnet password.  This password is the same password used to log into My Olivet and on campus computers.  If you are a faculty or staff member, it is a different password than your email password.  If you are a student and have used the Change My Password site, it should sync the two passwords.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Even if you are sure that you are using the correct password but still cannot log into the library databases, please go to IT's <a href="http://changemypassword.olivet.edu/" target="_blank">Change My Password</a> site.  The link to Change My Password is located in the upper right-hand corner of all library webpages, under the header Campus Links.  Click on "Change Your Password," type in your username, and follow the onscreen directions to check and then change your password.  For additional help, view the <a href="/help/technology/change-my-password.php" >Change My Password Tutorial</a>.
