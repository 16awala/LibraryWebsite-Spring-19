		<p>To complete the setup, you will need to know the following logins and passwords.
			<ol>
				<li>The ONU network.  This is the login on your office computer when you first login in the morning.</li>
				<li>ONU Outlook email. This is the login you use if youâ€™re checking your email from home using a web browser.</li>
				<li>Your Apple iTunes account.  This is the login you use if you have an iPod, iPhone or Mac Laptop account with iTunes.  You can setup an Apple ID at <a href="https://appleid.apple.com">https://appleid.apple.com</a>.</li>
				<li>If someone in your family already has an Apple device, they may have already set up an iTunes account.  We highly recommend that you set up your iPad with a unique Apple ID (step above), but share an iTunes account so that you have access to each other's music, videos, apps, etc. Be sure to bring that Apple ID credential.</li>
				<li>If you have any other email accounts, you will need your login information for those.  Gmail, Yahoo, Exchange, iCloud, AOL, and Outlook.com include automated setup functions.  Other accounts can be set up with additional information.</li>
			</ol>

			*If you already have an Apple Device, setup will be different and may take a little longer.<br />
			*Informatics will use the <a id="pdf" href="/help/technology/ipad/doc/ipad-set-up-v2.pdf">iPad Set Up pdf</a> to guide you in this process.
