<h2 class="header-line">Library Computer Sound Policy</h2>
        
        <p>
        The speakers have been permanently disabled<br />
        on the library main floor pod computers and on the second and third floors.<br />
        You are welcome to use headphones with most of these <br />computers, except the booth computers which have sound completely disabled.<br /><br />
        If you do not have headphones,<br />
        you can check them out from the General Purpose Lab on the lower level.<br />
        They are free to use for two hour blocks of time.<br /><br />

        If you need to use a computer with actual speakers,<br />
        please use an Apple computer in the Instruction Lab (the group study lab).<br /><br />
